# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Offsyde is built by engineers, for engineers. We are committed to providing a professional, harassment-free environment for everyone who participates in this project -- regardless of experience level, background, identity, or perspective.

This isn't about policing opinions. It's about maintaining a space where technical collaboration actually works.

## Values

- **Technical rigor over ego.** Challenge ideas, not people. Be direct, but constructive.
- **Signal over noise.** Keep discussions focused. Respect others' time.
- **Assume competence.** Explain context, not condescension. Everyone is here to build something.
- **Own your mistakes.** Bugs happen, bad assumptions happen. Acknowledge them and move forward.

## Expected Behavior

- Provide clear, constructive feedback in code reviews and discussions.
- Disagree respectfully. Back up technical arguments with reasoning, not authority.
- Welcome newcomers. Point people to relevant docs and prior discussions rather than dismissing questions.
- Stay on topic in issues and PRs. Take unrelated conversations to appropriate channels.
- Credit others' work. If you build on someone's idea or code, acknowledge it.
- Use inclusive language. Avoid unnecessary jargon when clarity serves better.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following will not be tolerated in any project space:

- Harassment, threats, or intimidation of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments -- including those framed as "jokes."
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Doxxing or sharing others' private information without consent.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, reviews, or project workflows.
- Trolling, flamebait, or bad-faith argumentation.
- Dismissing or attacking someone for their experience level, identity, or background.
- Publishing others' private communications without permission.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Code review comments
- Commit messages
- Project-related communication in any channel (Discord, email, social media)
- Representing the project at events or in public forums

It applies to all participants: contributors, maintainers, and community members.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, report it to:

**Email:** `conduct@offsyde.dev` *(placeholder -- update with actual contact)*

Reports will be handled confidentially. Include:

- What happened (with links, screenshots, or timestamps if possible)
- Who was involved
- Any relevant context

You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. All reports will be reviewed by maintainers who are not involved in the incident.

We will never retaliate against someone for making a good-faith report.

## Enforcement

Violations are handled proportionally:

### 1. Warning

**Trigger:** First-time or minor violation (e.g., unconstructive comment, off-topic disruption).

**Action:** Private written warning with explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. The participant is expected to acknowledge and correct course.

### 2. Temporary Suspension

**Trigger:** Repeated violations, or a single serious violation (e.g., targeted harassment, personal attack).

**Action:** Temporary ban from all project spaces for a defined period (typically 7-30 days). Conditions for return will be clearly stated. Violating the suspension terms results in a permanent ban.

### 3. Permanent Ban

**Trigger:** Pattern of violations after prior enforcement, or a single egregious act (e.g., threats, doxxing, sustained harassment).

**Action:** Permanent removal from all project spaces with no appeal.

## Maintainer Responsibility

Maintainers are expected to:

- Model the behavior outlined in this document.
- Enforce this Code of Conduct consistently and impartially.
- Recuse themselves from enforcement decisions where they have a conflict of interest.
- Remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, with clear explanation.
- Treat enforcement actions as confidential. Do not publicly discuss reports or disciplinary actions.

Maintainers who fail to uphold this Code of Conduct may themselves face consequences, determined by other project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct draws principles from the communities behind Kubernetes, Rust, and React, adapted to fit Offsyde's culture and scale. It is a living document and will evolve as the project grows.
